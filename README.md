This code is a parameter-based (System Time, System Date and MAC Address) cipher generation program. You can adjust it according to your needs.

# Features:

1. Generate one cipher with a length between 4 to 20 characters

2. Generate one cipher with random length

3. Generate cipher in a period of 1 to 120 seconds with a length of 4 to 20 characters

4. Generate cipher at random period with random length

# Attention:

1. All ciphers generated in this program are temporary and this program does not store any information.

2. The ciphers generated in this program are completely random and can not be returned, so if you use this code to register in a special software or sites, be sure to save the relevant cipher in a safe place.
